# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose

### We were instructed to scrape several other websites for data and images regarding Mars ranging from news articles to data regarding the physical properties of Mars. Splinter and BeautifulSoup were used to gather this information from several different sources. Given the nature of the scraped data and its lack of uniformity, the data was stored into a Mongo Database given its ability to handle data of a variety of types. Our data was then rendered onto a page using a flask app.  The html code for the page was also edited to accomodate mobile mobile devices and to organize the page. 

### The Client also wanted to add iamges regarding Mar's hemispheres.  To do this, we used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
